# RobotWars
A fleet of hand built robots are due to engage in battle for the annual “Robot Wars” competition. Each
robot will be placed within a rectangular battle arena and will navigate their way around the arena using
a built-in computer system.
The arena is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. A robot’s current location and heading is a
combination two integers representing the x and y coordinates on the grid, and a single character value
representing the current heading. The heading can be one of the four cardinal compass points (N, S, E
and W). An example location might be 0, 0, N which means the robot is in the bottom left corner and
facing North. The arena size is fixed at 5 by 5, giving 25 possible (x, y) coordinate positions. Assume that
the grid point directly North-East from (x, y) is (x+1, y+1).
